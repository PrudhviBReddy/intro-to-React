      <p className="IPL">The Indian Premier League (IPL), also known as the TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons, is a men's Twenty20 (T20) cricket league held annually in India.<br></br>
         Founded by the BCCI (the Board of Control for Cricket in India) in 2007, the league features ten state or city-based franchise teams.<br></br>
          The IPL usually takes place during the summer, between March and May each year.<br></br>
           It has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme, resulting in fewer international cricket tours occurring during the IPL seasons.</p>
